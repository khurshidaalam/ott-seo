            <p class="what-is-text">Search engine optimization (SEO) is like free publicity — very valuable. It’s the
                process of increasing the visibility of your website in Google or another search engine’s unpaid
                (“organic”) results. It’s often referred to as “natural search,” “organic search,” or “earned search”
                results.</p>

            <p class="what-is-sub">With 142 years of collective experience in search engine optimization, we use safe,

                                You might think that you know what SEO really is, but we promise you it’s much, much
                                more than you can even imagine. <br />
                                We can make your phone ring off its hook and drastically increase online leads

                                We are THAT good at what we do, and that is why we know we have to be very selective

                                to justify why you need them month after month, OTT SEO is only interested in working
                                with those businesses who see the marketing relationship with OTT and their business as
                                the electricity that generates revenue and grows market share.

                                <p>Search engines have always had rules. You must play by those rules. If you don’t — if
                                    you try to
                                    trick Google (you think) into ranking your site higher — you will get caught. And
                                    you will pay.
                                    Maybe not now, maybe not in 1 month but eventually Google always finds SEO cheaters
                                    &amp;
                                    troublemakers. By most accounts, they have about 900,000 servers in 16 data centers

                                    world. Google’s servers use around 260 million watts of electricity — about 0.01% of
                                    global
                                    energy use — enough to power a city of 200,000 people. Google’s servers are always
                                    on, always
                                    crawling the web, and they will find you if your site doesn’t play by their rules.
                                    So, really
                                    now, instead of taking stupid risks with your business which could directly affect
                                    your actual
                                    life, just do us all a favor and play by their rules. If you don’t know them, well…
                                    come see if
                                    you qualify so you don’t have to worry too much about that anymore.</p>

                                <p> Many have tried to do SEO on their own and got “slapped” (penalized) by Google for
                                    breaking
                                    rules that change almost daily. Many of our current clients were, at some point,
                                    victims of
                                    Black-Hat SEOs who promised them lightning fast results and just flooded the
                                    internet with
                                    thousands of spammy pages and worthless backlinks. You probably spent countless
                                    hours and
                                    wheelbarrows of money trying to rank, yet never saw an increase in web traffic.
                                    In other cases, many pay good money to an SEO agency that merely implements cookie
                                    cutter SEO
                                    strategies and never really addresses their problems and, a few months later, leaves
                                    them right
                                    where they started. No matter what bad experiences you’ve had with other SEO
                                    companies before,
                                    you’re not to blame (the first time), but shame on you for not doing your research.
                                    Now, the SEO
                                    rules have drastically changed, and you most likely WON’T have a 3rd chance. So,
                                    going the
                                    black-hat way a 2nd time would be acting in a very irresponsible way towards
                                    yourself and your
                                    business. <br>
                                    Keeping up with SEO is a tough game, everlasting, unpredictable, and, in most cases,
                                    life-changing. Google and other search engines change their rules almost every day,
                                    and many
                                    so-called SEO experts take advantage of those who are not used to it. Let’s be
                                    honest, you can’t
                                    be expected to keep up. You are a business owner who’s killing it and are expecting
                                    to get
                                    bigger, and you have better things to do than to spend 16 hours a day figuring out
                                    what Google
                                    is changing. HOWEVER, just like you won’t allow anyone to tell you how to do your
                                    job, let’s be
                                    clear that, if you qualify and are accepted to become our client, you can’t EVER
                                    tell us how to
                                    do our jobs.</p>

                    competitors, because we assure you they are getting your visitors, your customers and your calls…

                            <p>As Certified Google Partners, we play by the rules. We work with you to give Google and
                                other search engines exactly what they want. That means you get more traffic to your
                                website
                                and more customers for your business, without fear of getting your site “slapped” or

                                due to “black-hat” methods that Google frowns upon. (And if you found us on Google or
                                another search engine, you’ve just found proof that our SEO methods work.) <br>
                                We are strong believers in the power of people in their local communities and
                                surroundings.
                                We partnered with Google in a way only a handful of SEO companies in the entire world
                                have,
                                giving us the ability to create laser-focused local campaigns for local businesses or

                    <p>With all the responsibilities you have running a business, you may not have the time to master
                        search engine optimization (SEO). I understand. Keeping up with Google and SEO can be extremely
                        difficult. That’s why, unlike other SEO firms who like to take anyone and everyone in, no matter
                        the quality or abilities for that matter, we eliminate anyone we think or even remotely consider
                        we won’t be able to help. We don’t want to mislead you into thinking we will bring you to the
                        promised land if we don’t know for a fact that we can. <br><br>I am hungry, I am very, very
                        hungry, starving for more power, more success, more money. But also more of helping others
                        achieve their maximum potential and fulfilling their dreams and aspirations. This has made MY
                        dreams come true and made me who I am, I’ve done so in more times than my hands can count, I can
                        do the same for you. But there are rules. Rules that are not meant to be broken or tampered
                        with. <br><br>I am looking for the “Me’s” out there. Seriously, men and women out there, if you
                        feel like there is something missing inside you, if you feel that you are not fully satisfied
                        with how things are with your business at its current state, if you feel that you could be the
                        best of the best if only you didn’t have to worry about having enough clients to cover all of
                        your expenses. Well then, I am looking for you. <br><br>If you are already successful at what
                        you are doing and simply want to grow, if you know how it’s like to conquer a peak in your
                        career and you are ready for the next level, if you are a big boss with a ton of successful
                        businesses. Well then, I am looking for you as well. <br><br>I hope we meet soon.</p>

                                    <p>Due to the nature of our business, we recently had to close our doors to most new
                                        clients to only let potential partners in. Why? Simply put, because&nbsp;we are
                                        not an ordinary SEO company. But if you have read this far, you probably noticed
                                        that already. Before taking in a new partner company, we perform a full SWOT
                                        analysis&nbsp;(Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) on them, and
                                        screen through a very detailed questionnaire. These elements are essential to
                                        accurately assess newcomers’ real standing (not just their perceived situation)
                                        and judge if a partnership would be a good match or not. If you think you got
                                        what it takes to play in the majors, then, by all means, get in touch. We’ll
                                        talk and take it from there.</p>

                                    <p>An SEO company is a firm that implements marketing tactics aimed at search
                                        engines (SE). The O in “SEO” stands for Optimization. This generally refers to
                                        the changes that need to occur on a website for search engines to notice your
                                        optimization efforts and reward you with higher ranking in search results. In
                                        short, SEO is the process of making changes to the design and contents of your
                                        website to make sure it is attractive to all search engines.</p>

                                    <p>Whether you should or shouldn’t hire an SEO company depends on several factors
                                        such as your budget, your available time, your knowledge, and your business
                                        goals. You should consider hiring an SEO company: -If you want to focus your
                                        time on the operative side of your business-You know little or nothing about SEO
                                        and what it entails-You don’t have time to learn everything you need to know
                                        about search engine optimization… An SEO company is a collection of individuals
                                        with the knowledge and the passion for making any website or platform stand out
                                        from the crowd and stay there indefinitely. Usually, they bring the firepower
                                        you need to take on battles that seem impossible to win. Having a solid SEO firm
                                        by your side will not only bring the needed exposure and traffic related to
                                        increased online presence. It also shields you from sudden changes in search
                                        engine algorithms or even penalties. We only recommend that you do SEO yourself
                                        if you have a lot of time in your hands…</p>

                                    <p>Finding the right SEO company for your business depends on many factors. What´s
                                        ideal for some, might be actually pretty harmful for others, and there are
                                        various reasons for that. Digital marketing is a term that encompasses too many
                                        factors for an SEO company to cover them all. They all specialize in a few
                                        areas, often leaving others unattended. For example, you might have a website
                                        with a sound On-Page structure working perfectly in technical sense. So, hiring
                                        an SEO company that only focuses on optimizing your structure, responsiveness,
                                        load speeds and overall design will not make much sense. The same goes with
                                        startups with a strong branding awareness. They usually create awesome products
                                        and content, but struggle to get noticed by Google and social media platforms.
                                        These startups certainly benefit from having a team of experienced technical
                                        SEOs. They often only need people who know the ins and outs of search engines.
                                        That means that digital marketing agencies that focus on content creation and
                                        branding will not be as…</p>

                            <p>Based on our most successful results and relationships, we looked at what we did
                                differently than others and discovered basic, simple commonalities in design and
                                development between these diverse organizations.</br>
                                </br>
                                These principles, when acted on, ultimately revealed themselves on our clients' bottom
                                line. We believe that to withhold these revelations would be of the highest disservice
                                to the health and strength of the businesses we're championing with our apps. </br>
                                </br>

                                While these principles are basic and simple, they may not be easy for everyone. We've
                                discovered not every business is prepared to or at the point where we can trust them to
                                achieve their goals. What we do know is if an organization is prepared to dance within
                                these principles, we have no doubt that we can win it together.
